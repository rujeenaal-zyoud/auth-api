# auth-api



### Description :

While Authentication answers the question "Who are you?" ... or more specifically "Are you who you say you are?", Authorization takes the next step and asks "Are you allowed to do the thing you're asking to do?"

Given a proper and valid user with a set of permissions, we can grant or restrict access to anything in our server.
